    Curious to see how Named Entity Recognition works in practice? Use this tool to input your own sentences and watch as the system identifies entities in real time.
    
    Type anything you likeâ€”maybe a news headline, a made-up story, or a sentence from your favorite bookâ€”and see which words the model picks out as names, places, organizations, dates, and more. As you experiment, pay attention to the context. Which words does the system correctly recognize? Which ones does it miss or misinterpret?
    
    This is your chance to think like an algorithm: what clues is it using to make decisions, and where might it be getting confused?
    
    Try to trick it. Surprise it. See what happens!
